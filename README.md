# Fashion-MNIST Image Classification Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning–based image classification system using the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The goal is to classify grayscale images of clothing items into predefined fashion categories through data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

The project demonstrates an end-to-end supervised learning workflow and serves as a foundational implementation for image classification tasks.
